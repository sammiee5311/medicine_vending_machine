# Medicine Vending Machine

## Motivation

The number of graduates has increased since the change to six-year graduation of pharmacists, but pharmacists are gradually disappearing. This means that it is difficult to hire pharmacists from existing pharmacies, and the time of pharmacists' turnover has been accelerated. Pharmacies and hospitals in big cities and the metropolitan area, which were relatively easy to hire pharmacists, are also difficulty to hire pharmacists. A remote medicine vending machine is created to allow people to work at night and at their houses.
